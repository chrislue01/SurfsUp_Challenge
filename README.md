# SurfsUp_Challenge

Background
W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.


What You're Creating
This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report. You will submit the following:
Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December

Results
June Temp:

These two tables tell us about the differing weather patterns for the two monthly periods.


Summary:

Overall the weather in December and June are similar, although December has a wider range of results, with its high being close to June's but its low well below June's.
